%% Notes
%%
%% This LaTeX source automatically generates the cover pages for an Hystrix issue.
%% Cover pages consists of:
%% - a front cover page, which is automatically generated by the macro
%%   \hysfrontcover
%% - a front endpaper (i.e. the verso of the cover page) , automatically generated
%%   by \hysfrontendpaper. Should data appearing on this page be changed, change the
%%   \hysfrontendpaper macro in hystrixmacros.tex
%% - a back endpaper (i.e. the recto of the backcover), automatically  generated
%%   by \hysbackendpaper. Should data appearing on this page be changed, change the
%%   \hysbackendpaper macro in hystrixmacros.tex
%% - a back cover page, that must be typeset by hand, using the hysbackcover
%%   environment provided by hystrixmacros.tex
%%
%% To prepare an issue cover:
%% 1 get a copy of this file and place it into the directory containing all the 
%%   needed files to produce the issue.
